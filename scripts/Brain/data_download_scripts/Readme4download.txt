Change the LOCAL_DIR for each file to run the download

Files that are required:
- get mask from download_versionB_MNI152_GLMrest
- get searchlight RDMs and upper ceiling from download_versionB_MNI152_prepared_searchlight
- if you want some reference searchlight code from them, run download_versionB_scripts_searchlight, but I don't call any of them in our analysis
